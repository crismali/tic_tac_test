To play tic tac toe, make sure your current directory in terminal is
tic_tac_test . Then, assuming you have a version of ruby that supports
that either is 1.9.3 or is backwards compatible (1.8 might work, but I
haven't tested it), you simpy enter 'ruby play.rb' without the quotation marks
to play.

Enjoy!
